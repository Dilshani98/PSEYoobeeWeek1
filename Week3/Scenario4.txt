This OOP project is to develop & design a simple database using python & sqlite3 for 
managing a clinic system as mentioned in the activity5.

This database includes three entities as Doctors, SpecializedAreas, & Patients. 
ER diagram attached here will give more details about the specifications of the tables.
In this project we use python with sqlite3 to connect
with the database & insert 3 sample data into each table. Project includes the relevant functions to execute the queries to retrieve 
the list with full information of all patients who are classified as seniors(>65 years) in the clinic and display the total number of doctors who specialise in ophthalmology.

There are inline comments in the code itself for the understanding of the concepts.
